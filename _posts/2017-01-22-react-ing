React.js means breaking with the dominant MVC frameworks style.
React.js means componenents.
React.js components may have the state.
React.js components may not have the state (stateless).
React.js components view (V) is function of state (S); V=f(S).

On state change React components will be redrawn.
However, the React tip is about creating the stateless components.
These can be controled with the param input paramters.

We use Bable with React today:
In Babel `const element = <div />;` will convert to `const element = React.createElement("div", null);`
